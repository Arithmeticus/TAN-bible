TAN-formatted transcriptions and alignments of assorted types of
biblical material

Because TAN (http://textalign.net) is under development, the prolog for
these files point to a local sibling directory called TAN-1-dev to
access validation files. This is intended to assist the testing and
editing of the schemas locally. To use this option, you must place in
that TAN-1-dev folder the latest schema files, found at either
http://textalign.net/release/1/dev/schemas/ or
https://github.com/textalign/release-1-dev.

Alternately, you may switch the prolog to the master location, currently
commented out.
